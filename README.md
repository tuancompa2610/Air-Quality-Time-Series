# About Repository
In this repository build an ARMA time-series model to predict particulate matter levels in Kenya. Then I will extract data from a MongoDB database using pymongo, and improve model performance through hyperparameter tuning.

This project was inspired by the lesson I learned in [WQU](https://www.wqu.edu/)
  
# Installation
This is a Jupyter notebook. Package requirements are included in requirement.txt. This project uses Python 3.9. Run the following command in terminal to install the required packages. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
  
# Useage
The notebook includes all the markdowns which explain the process.
